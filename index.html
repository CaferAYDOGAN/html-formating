            Semantics in HTML
        </b>

<p>
  
    &#128073; In HTML,for example,the element is a semantic element,which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
</p>

<details>
    <summary>
        <mark>Here is a top level heading</mark> 
   
<br>

<p>
    &#128073;By default,most browser's user agent stylesheet will style an with a large font size to make it look like a heading (althoug you ccould style it to look like anything you wantet.)On the other hand,you could make any element lkk a top level heading.
</p>

      
<br>
        <details>
            <summary>
                <mark> Consider the following</mark>
            </summary>
        </details>

<br>

<p>
    &#10154    This will render it to look like a top level heading,but it has no semantic value,so it will not get any extra benefits as described above.It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for the right job.
</p>

<p>
    &#10154  HTML should be coded to repsent the data that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling.Presentation (how it should look),is the sole responsibility of CSS

            Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:

    </legend>
    <ul>
        <li>Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO">SEO</a>) </li>
        <li>Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page</li>
        <li>Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or semantic or namespaced classes </li>
        <li>Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated</li>
        <li>Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming</li>
